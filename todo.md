# Launch

- remove delve

# After launch

- 

- Copy button.
- Search - how to do that?
- anthropic and openai apis
- System prompt, e.g. always use UK English
- Starred pages
- Settings: default detail level for new pages
- Dark mode
- Can we improve the smoothness of back navigation by, instead of refreshing, preemptively changing the link colour before we navigate?
- disambiguation, e.g. Port, Field (maybe have the LLM proactively generate disambiguated links)
- I don't like the current suggestions of the new page which are machine learning, ancient Greece, /ugh bread and DNS. I want to make them much more suggestive to a broader audience. Machine learning is wrong for a start. That should be AI. Ancient Greece is good. sourdough bread. I don't want to think of it as sourdough bread. Everything will open this. DNS is good. What else?
